AuntBee's Hello-World repository
Hello, I am AuntBee I play a lot of Minecraft and modded Minecraft in particular SkyFactory 2, 2.5, and 3 most recently. I love the
factory mod because I can figure out how to automate just about any process to make my job less involved to productive towards small goals
I set for myself. My mind works in mysterious ways and I have always wanted to do something with my mind and make a difference in the
world so I am hoping learning coding can help me reach out and change something in the world. I love computers matter of fact I built my
computer myself. I am very proud of what I have achieved in my building it. I have youtube channels AuntBeeDoesGames, AuntBeeDoesMinecraft
and RabekaJo :) Still haven't made it big there yet, so venturing down a different path and hope I end up making some sort of income for
my family of 5. My husband works so hard and if I could just take a portion of the stress of him I would be so greatful. So I hope I can
learn this and end up finding a way to make money so we can stop going into debt every month and actually have breathing room for the
emergencies that seem to never stop coming at us. (home ownership sucks, landlording is hardest thing ever, not to mention kids who
constantly hurting themselves and getting sick ugh its never endiing it seems). I have had 7 total children and I hope soon my oldest two
will come find me after being adopted out years ago they are about to turn 18 and I am excited. Then I have two boys and one girl at home
and then one girl who had HLHS and Turner Syndrome and lived 19hrs and 34mins. Then one boy who was stillborn at 28 weeks along. Been
through the ringer and been so depressed I can't seem to get out of this funk I been in lately...hopefully this will help boost my self
esteem and get me feeling better as computers have always been a passion of mine...I love technology...and if I can make it then maybe I
can feel even better about myself...and in turn make a difference in the world I hope at least...thanks for reading
